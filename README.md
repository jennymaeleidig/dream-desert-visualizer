Dream Desert Visualizer - p5.js Port

A p5.js port of the Dream Desert Visualizer originally created in Processing by Jenny Leidig.

My interpretation of [夢の砂漠](https://geometriclullaby.bandcamp.com/album/desert-sand-feels-warm-at-night) (_dream desert_) by [desert sand feels warm at night](https://desertsand.bandcamp.com/) and [Secret Schools](https://www.instagram.com/secretschools/)

Built with p5.js & GLSL

Assets re-created by hand
